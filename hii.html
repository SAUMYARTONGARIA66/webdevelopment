    <i><h3>Data Structure:</h3></i>
    <p><i>The data structure and algorithm provide a set of techniques to the programmer for handling the data efficiently. The data structure concept can be implement in any Programming language. They can write the code in any Programming language with minimal effort.</i></p>
<h3><i>C Programming:</i></h3>
<p><i>C is a powerful general-purpose Programming language. It can be used to develop software like Operating System,Database,Compiler and so on. C Programming is an excellent languageto learn to program for beginners.</i></p>
<h3><i>Discreate Mathematics:</i></h3>
<p><i>Discrete math will help you with the "Algorithms, Complexity and Computability Theory" part of the focus more than programming language. The last important concept to grab out of discrete math is boolean algebra. This is very useful not only for creating logical solution, but it is very useful in programming too</i></p>
<h3><i>Operating System:</i></h3>
<p><i>An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.</i></p>
<h3><i>Computer Architecture and Organization:</i></h3>
<p><i>The study of computer architecture and organization focuses on the interface between hardware and software, and emphasizes the structure and behavior of the system. As Computer Scientists, we need a basic understanding of computer system itself in order to rectify these problems</i></p>
<h3><i>Web Development:</i></h3>
<p><i>Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you are offering, understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and see which of your company's qualities set it apart from competitors.</i></p>
